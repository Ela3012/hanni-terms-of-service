## 2. Data We Collect
The Bot collects minimal data necessary to provide its functionalities:
- **Discord User Data**: User IDs, usernames, and avatars to identify users and process commands.

## 3. Use of Collected Data
The collected data is used exclusively for:
- Processing user commands.
- Storing game progress (e.g., inventory and balance).
- Implementing cooldowns and preventing spam.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not share or sell user data to any third parties.

## 5. Data Security
All stored data is handled securely and is only accessible to the bot owner.

## 6. User Rights
Users can request to view or delete their data by contacting the bot owner through Discord. Upon deletion, all associated data will be removed.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Significant changes will be communicated to users.

## 8. Contact
For questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the bot owner via Discord.
